.SH "NAME"
\fBbats\fR \- Bash Automated Testing System
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
bats [\-c] [\-p | \-t] \fItest\fR [\fItest\fR \.\.\.]
.
.P
\fItest\fR is the path to a Bats test file, or the path to a directory containing Bats test files\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Bats is a TAP\-compliant testing framework for Bash\. It provides a simple way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected\.
.
.P
A Bats test file is a Bash script with special syntax for defining test cases\. Under the hood, each test case is just a function with a description\.
.
.P
Test cases consist of standard shell commands\. Bats makes use of Bash\'s \fBerrexit\fR (\fBset \-e\fR) option when running test cases\. If every command in the test case exits with a \fB0\fR status code (success), the test passes\. In this way, each line is an assertion of truth\.
.
.P
See \fBbats\fR(7) for more information on writing Bats tests\.
.
.SH "RUNNING TESTS"
To run your tests, invoke the \fBbats\fR interpreter with a path to a test file\. The file\'s test cases are run sequentially and in isolation\. If all the test cases pass, \fBbats\fR exits with a \fB0\fR status code\. If there are any failures, \fBbats\fR exits with a \fB1\fR status code\.
.
.P
You can invoke the \fBbats\fR interpreter with multiple test file arguments, or with a path to a directory containing multiple \fB\.bats\fR files\. Bats will run each test file individually and aggregate the results\. If any test case fails, \fBbats\fR exits with a \fB1\fR status code\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-count\fR
Count the number of test cases without running any tests
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help message
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pretty\fR
Show results in pretty format (default for terminals)
.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tap\fR
Show results in TAP format
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the version number
.
.SH "OUTPUT"
When you run Bats from a terminal, you\'ll see output as each test is performed, with a check\-mark next to the test\'s name if it passes or an "X" if it fails\.

.P
If Bats is not connected to a terminal\-\-in other words, if you run it from a continuous integration system or redirect its output to a file\-\-the results are displayed in human\-readable, machine\-parsable TAP format\. You can force TAP output from a terminal by invoking Bats with the \fB\-\-tap\fR option\.
